Our Development Process
We use GitHub to sync code to and from our internal repository. We'll use GitHub to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
If you've added code that should be tested, then state about it in the PR description.
If you've changed APIs, update the documentation (in the readme file at the moment).
The PR title should begin with _(<issue_number>): _ e.g. - "feat(#12): ", "chore(#12): ", "fix(#12): ", "refactor(#12):" and "test(#12):"
Make sure your code satisfies the coding conventions used in the rest of the project.
Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.
